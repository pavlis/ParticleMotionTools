/* This is a template file for building a unix style filter for 
the seispp library using boost serialization.   The example is
known to work only for reading a single object from stdin (e.g. the 
ThreeComponentEnsemble used in this example) and writing a 
modified version of that object to stdout.  As I understand the
boost serialization library and C++ streams, however, there is no
reason this should not work with a stream file of an undefined number
of the same objects or even different objects arranged in known order.

This example simply copies a serialized ThreeComponentEnsemble from 
stdin to stdout.   make should build it under the name template. 

See comments below to see how to customize this for a different algorithm.
You can also look at examples that (at least for now) are in the directory
one up from where this file is located. 

You should, of course, strip all the template comments when you 
get your program to work.
